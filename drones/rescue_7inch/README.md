# Isolated TBS Source One V5 7-inch rescue drone

This stack is independent of the legacy Iris and earlier `rescue_7inch`
development artifact. It targets a TBS Source One V5 7-inch deadcat frame.

## Physical target

- 1.5 kg AUW, including the 300 g battery
- 4 × 2807 1350 KV motors
- 4 × 7×4 propellers
- Zeus 50 A 4-in-1 ESC
- 4S 5000 mAh 10C battery
- iFlight BLITZ Mini F745 architecture: ICM42688, DPS310, BZ251 GPS, QMC5883 compass
- Raspberry Pi with downward camera only

The Source One V5 7-inch wheelbase is represented as a 320 mm diagonal
assumption. Verify against the physical frame before using this as measured
aircraft data. Motor thrust coefficients remain first-pass simulation values
until measured data is available.

The default world starts calm while the physical wind system is loaded. Wind
profiles should be tested in this order: calm, 5 m/s, 5 m/s with gusts, then
10 m/s. The existing Iris stack is not changed by this package.

## Wind input

The launcher asks for base strength, direction, strength randomness, direction
randomness, and duration. It can also be called non-interactively:

```bash
cd ~/drone_project
drones/rescue_7inch/start/start_sim.sh 10 90 10 20 60
```

This means 10 m/s base wind, direction 90 degrees, +/-10 m/s strength
variation, +/-20 degrees direction variation, for 60 seconds. The controller
publishes a new physical wind vector every four seconds with an abrupt change,
then returns to calm at the end.

## Ports

| Function | Port |
|---|---:|
| Gazebo JSON | 9003 |
| QGroundControl MAVLink | 14560 |
| MAVROS MAVLink | 14561 |

## Launch

```bash
cd ~/drone_project
drones/rescue_7inch/start/start_sim.sh
```

The launcher starts the complete isolated Gazebo, ArduCopter, MAVProxy,
MAVROS, camera, GCS, QR, mission, and wind-controller stack.
